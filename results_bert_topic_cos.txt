Google is lobbying Labor and crossbench MPs to oppose a proposed code that would require digital platforms to pay news media companies for content, urging them to “carefully consider the proposal to ensure it operates in the best interests of Australians”.
The chair of PIJI, Allan Fels, a former chair of the ACCC, said there was a danger in excluding the ABC and SBS. “There is a real chance that digital platforms will adopt far more of their content than from news organisations whose content they have to fund,” Fels said.

The direct lobbying effort supplements the tech giant’s major digital campaign, which includes a post on Google’s home page, and pop-up advertisements on Google Search, Chrome and YouTube to mobilise its huge user base against the proposal.
The Centre for Responsible Technology agreed there were dangers in allowing Facebook and Google to use taxpayer-funded journalism without a fee. The platforms “may be incentivised to prefer their content to content for which they have to pay”, the centre said in its submission.

Guardian Australia understands Google has made direct approaches to a number of key MPs in an attempt to convince them against supporting the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) draft code for digital platforms.
Google has taken the fight against the legislation down to the wire, bombarding Australian users with a yellow hazard warning that states: “The way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk from new government regulation”, and repeating the message on YouTube’s social media accounts.

Government MPs have been approached to set up meetings, as has Labor’s shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, the Greens media and communication spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, and others on the crossbench.
The draft mandatory news code does not require the digital platforms to share revenue with the public broadcasters because they are funded by the taxpayer.

Guardian Australia has also seen an email sent to MPs by Hannah Frank, Google’s government affairs and public policy manager, warning the code gives “big media companies special treatment” and encourages them to make “enormous and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at risk”.
In a joint submission the Public Interest Journalism Initiative and the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas called on the ACCC to amend the code to include the ABC and SBS, but use the revenue to fund public interest journalism.

The email asks MPs to consider alternatives proposed by Google.
“Final offer arbitration has much to offer but it is extremely important that the bargaining power of all parties big and small is equally protected and this is one way of doing that.”

“We understand the draft code will be introduced to parliament ‘shortly after’ the close of consultation on 28 August,” Frank wrote. “We ask you to carefully consider the proposal to ensure it operates in the best interests of Australians.”

The lobbying effort comes amid reports that MPs are being inundated with automated emails criticising the proposal.
The consultation period for the draft mandatory code under which Google will be forced to pay Australian media companies for news appearing on Google closed on Friday.

The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday that the emails contained scripted text labelling the code an “assault on Australia’s democracy”, which appeared to stem from a Change.org petition from an anonymous YouTuber called “Economics Explained”.
The chair of PIJI, Allan Fels, a former chair of the ACCC, said there was a danger in excluding the ABC and SBS. “There is a real chance that digital platforms will adopt far more of their content than from news organisations whose content they have to fund,” Fels said.

Google denied any connection to that YouTube channel.
“Clearly, digital platforms derive direct and indirect value from the volume of news content generated by public broadcasters, particularly as the ABC and SBS are the most trusted news sources in Australia,” the PIJI submission says.

The ACCC has stated that Google will not be required to charge Australians for using free services like Google Search and YouTube “unless it chooses to do so”.

Google says that every digital service Google and Facebook provide that uses news content will be affected by the code.
“It is difficult to imagine an issue more pertinent in this digital age than the decline of media revenues and the overwhelming power of Google and Facebook,” Lewis said.

Consultation on the ACCC’s proposal finishes on Friday. The code is aimed at addressing the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants such as Facebook and Google, and force the platforms to pay for the value they receive from use of Australian journalism.
The Centre for Responsible Technology agreed there were dangers in allowing Facebook and Google to use taxpayer-funded journalism without a fee. The platforms “may be incentivised to prefer their content to content for which they have to pay”, the centre said in its submission.

The code would also require Google and Facebook to provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic, such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm.
“It is difficult to imagine an issue more pertinent in this digital age than the decline of media revenues and the overwhelming power of Google and Facebook,” Lewis said.

Google is not alone in lobbying on this issue. Media companies, including News Corp and Nine, have engaged in a major public campaign to pressure government to regulate the digital giants.
Google and Facebook should pay to use ABC and SBS content as well as news produced by commercial media, public interest journalism advocates have told the competition watchdog.

Weaknesses in Australia’s lobbying transparency regimes mean the public cannot see which companies are lobbying on which issue at any one time.

A Google spokesman confirmed the company was engaging constructively with the government and “parliamentarians from all parties”. He said this was to share the company’s perspective and deliver a fairer code.
“We know that Google and Facebook have become the dominant advertising platforms. We also know the impact this has had on media outlets – with more than 5,000 jobs disappeared in the past decade.”

“This code as it stands is essentially unworkable,” he said. “On its current terms, it would take away the fairness, independence and objectivity of products like Google Search and YouTube. As a result the draft code will significantly impact the products and services used by millions of Australians and Australian small businesses every day.”
In a joint submission the Public Interest Journalism Initiative and the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas called on the ACCC to amend the code to include the ABC and SBS, but use the revenue to fund public interest journalism.

He said Google was not opposed to the principle of a code, and would support one that was “workable and fair”.
“Our proposal is aimed at overcoming the concern that small innovators in public interest journalism could otherwise come out badly under the final offer arbitration process,” professor Fels said.
