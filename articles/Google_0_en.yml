- "Fast forward to 2025. The annus horribilis, 2020, is in the fairly distant past.\
  \ The popular esports national championship is taking place \u2014-between two powerhouse\
  \ higher education teams \u2014Google and Microsoft. Just as a century earlier America\
  \ fixated on the Harvard vs. Yale football game, and later ball throwing contests\
  \ between top SEC universities known more for football than learning, schools like\
  \ Alabama and Ole Miss, now the insurgent for profit high tech giants are battling."
- "Far fetched fiction? Not necessarily. Both Google and Microsoft, along with many\
  \ other high tech private powerhouses, are moving headlong into teaching employable\
  \ skills, and certifying vocational competence. Why? For many Americans, traditional\
  \ higher education is vastly too expensive and too hung up on weird and even threatening\
  \ left-wing ideology and indoctrination, rather than scholarly dissemination and\
  \ discovery. Many mostly semi-affluent Americans still want four or five gap years\
  \ between adolescence and life, provided by residential \u201Ccolleges\u201D serving\
  \ the strange triple functions of country clubs, hedonistic party sites, and halls\
  \ of learning. However, an increasing proportion of the population of our slow growth,\
  \ aging and debt ridden society are just saying \u201Cno\u201D to traditional college."
- "Non-traditional providers of knowledge, like 2U and Coursera, are reportedly booming,\
  \ and a few nimble and risk-taking state universities like Purdue (which bought\
  \ Kaplan\u2019s on-line services, now Purdue Global) and the University of Arizona\
  \ (which is buying Ashford University) are moving into non-traditional modes of\
  \ delivery in big ways."
- "But now the big guns are getting really involved. Google is moving quickly to offer\
  \ high level vocational training via several Google Career Certificates, short courses\
  \ (six months or so of training) hosted on Coursera designed to offer a big vocational\
  \ return at a moderate cost\u2014many initial participants will get scholarships\
  \ from Google in its effort to quickly achieve critical scale economies. Not to\
  \ be left out, many of the other big names of high tech loaded with resources and\
  \ hoards of very bright people are moving in as well. Microsoft, for example, at\
  \ this writing has a new worth, based on market capitalization, of $1.72 trillion,\
  \ probably conservatively 25 times that of America\u2019s richest university, Harvard.\
  \ Even now, several coding academies have been doing well, in some cases charging\
  \ nothing for instruction in return for a share of the earnings of the graduates."
- "Let\u2019s do some forecasting (something economists do poorly). Let\u2019s use\
  \ an automotive analogy. In a few years, we will have perhaps 200 truly Lexus/Mercedes\
  \ type universities and residential colleges doing the triple functions described\
  \ above. We will have a few hundred mostly public Chevy/Ford/Honda type schools\
  \ struggling to do what Harvard, Claremont McKenna, etc. do. We will have, figuratively,\
  \ intensive care rooms and cemeteries filled with dying/dead minor league state\
  \ universities and private schools. And we will have Amazon, Google, Microsoft,\
  \ Facebook, Apple and undoubtedly some other agile new providers. The community\
  \ colleges may get brutalized in the process."
- The accreditation agencies that kept competition down and perceived undesirable
  riffraff out will be measurably weakened; the smart and savvy Mother Superior of
  Accreditation, Judith Eaton, president of the Council of Higher Education Accreditation,
  smartly just retired, ahead of the deluge. Meanwhile, new ways of certifying competence,
  perhaps something like my oft-proposed National College Equivalence Examination,
  will be created, as employers discover the 75% or even 100% wage premium that they
  have been paying for college degrees is too much, and that diplomas are an obscenely
  expensive screening device. Already some are dropping mindless degree requirements
  for jobs.
- I am only about 50% sure about all of this, but given my age and life expectancy,
  I can afford to take prognostication risks even as I prudently no longer buy green
  bananas or completely fill my gas tank. The Democratic Party derives a good deal
  of income and many of its ideas from the academy, and if it totally takes over the
  federal government, it may succeed in dramatically increasing subsidies to traditional
  higher education and putting barriers up against the new competition, such as by
  anti-trust suits trying to break up Google and Amazon and other regulatory barriers
  against those engaging in mortal sins like trying to make profits from American
  desires for more knowledge and discovery.
