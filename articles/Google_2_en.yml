paragraphs:
- Google and Facebook should pay to use ABC and SBS content as well as news produced
  by commercial media, public interest journalism advocates have told the competition
  watchdog.
- The funds collected from the digital platforms should be used to to set up an independent
  public interest journalism fund rather than be funnelled back into the public broadcasters,
  the Public Interest Journalism Initiative said in a final submission.
- 'The media industry has been hit hard by Covid-19: 29 newspapers and TV stations
  have closed down and a further 97 newspapers have ceased to produce print editions,
  PIJI said.'
- The consultation period for the draft mandatory code under which Google will be
  forced to pay Australian media companies for news appearing on Google closed on
  Friday.
- "Google has taken the fight against the legislation down to the wire, bombarding\
  \ Australian users with a yellow hazard warning that states: \u201CThe way Aussies\
  \ search every day on Google is at risk from new government regulation\u201D, and\
  \ repeating the message on YouTube\u2019s social media accounts."
- "If you're an Australian creator, the News Media Bargaining Code could impact you.\

- But the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has called the campaign misinformation
  and will draft the legislation now the final submissions are in.
- In a joint submission the Public Interest Journalism Initiative and the Judith Neilson
  Institute for Journalism and Ideas called on the ACCC to amend the code to include
  the ABC and SBS, but use the revenue to fund public interest journalism.
- "The chair of PIJI, Allan Fels, a former chair of the ACCC, said there was a danger\
  \ in excluding the ABC and SBS. \u201CThere is a real chance that digital platforms\
  \ will adopt far more of their content than from news organisations whose content\
  \ they have to fund,\u201D Fels said."
- "The Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Responsible Technology has also thrown\
  \ its weight behind the idea."
- The draft mandatory news code does not require the digital platforms to share revenue
  with the public broadcasters because they are funded by the taxpayer.
- "In March, ACCC chair Rod Sims said any revenue that came to the ABC as a result\
  \ of the new code \u201Cwould be applied to the delivery of ABC charter objectives\u201D\
  \ but after he delivered the code the ABC and SBS were excluded and he said that\
  \ was the government\u2019s choice."
- "\u201CClearly, digital platforms derive direct and indirect value from the volume\
  \ of news content generated by public broadcasters, particularly as the ABC and\
  \ SBS are the most trusted news sources in Australia,\u201D the PIJI submission\
  \ says."
- "\u201CIf Google and Facebook pay for content from News Corp and Nine, but not from\
  \ the public broadcasters, then in effect the Australian taxpayers are arguably\
  \ subsidising the digital platforms.\u201D"
- "The Centre for Responsible Technology agreed there were dangers in allowing Facebook\
  \ and Google to use taxpayer-funded journalism without a fee. The platforms \u201C\
  may be incentivised to prefer their content to content for which they have to pay\u201D\
  , the centre said in its submission."
- The director of the centre, Peter Lewis, said it was a critical moment that will
  define our relationship with the global technology platforms.
- "\u201CIt is difficult to imagine an issue more pertinent in this digital age than\
  \ the decline of media revenues and the overwhelming power of Google and Facebook,\u201D\
  \ Lewis said."
- "\u201CWe know that Google and Facebook have become the dominant advertising platforms.\
  \ We also know the impact this has had on media outlets \u2013 with more than 5,000\
  \ jobs disappeared in the past decade.\u201D"
- Fels also called for more clarity about how the revenue will be calculated and for
  more attention to be paid to how the smaller players will not be disadvantaged compared
  with News Corp and Nine Entertainment.
- "\u201COur proposal is aimed at overcoming the concern that small innovators in\
  \ public interest journalism could otherwise come out badly under the final offer\
  \ arbitration process,\u201D professor Fels said."
- "\u201CFinal offer arbitration has much to offer but it is extremely important that\
  \ the bargaining power of all parties big and small is equally protected and this\
  \ is one way of doing that.\u201D"
