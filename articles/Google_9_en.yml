- "Google is lobbying Labor and crossbench MPs to oppose a proposed code that would\
  \ require digital platforms to pay news media companies for content, urging them\
  \ to \u201Ccarefully consider the proposal to ensure it operates in the best interests\
  \ of Australians\u201D."
- "The direct lobbying effort supplements the tech giant\u2019s major digital campaign,\
  \ which includes a post on Google\u2019s home page, and pop-up advertisements on\
  \ Google Search, Chrome and YouTube to mobilise its huge user base against the proposal."
- Guardian Australia understands Google has made direct approaches to a number of
  key MPs in an attempt to convince them against supporting the Australian Competition
  and Consumer Commission (ACCC) draft code for digital platforms.
- "Government MPs have been approached to set up meetings, as has Labor\u2019s shadow\
  \ communications minister, Michelle Rowland, the Greens media and communication\
  \ spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, and others on the crossbench."
- "Guardian Australia has also seen an email sent to MPs by Hannah Frank, Google\u2019\
  s government affairs and public policy manager, warning the code gives \u201Cbig\
  \ media companies special treatment\u201D and encourages them to make \u201Cenormous\
  \ and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at risk\u201D."
- The email asks MPs to consider alternatives proposed by Google.
- "\u201CWe understand the draft code will be introduced to parliament \u2018shortly\
  \ after\u2019 the close of consultation on 28 August,\u201D Frank wrote. \u201C\
  We ask you to carefully consider the proposal to ensure it operates in the best\
  \ interests of Australians.\u201D"
- The lobbying effort comes amid reports that MPs are being inundated with automated
  emails criticising the proposal.
- "The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday that the emails contained scripted\
  \ text labelling the code an \u201Cassault on Australia\u2019s democracy\u201D,\
  \ which appeared to stem from a Change.org petition from an anonymous YouTuber called\
  \ \u201CEconomics Explained\u201D."
- Google denied any connection to that YouTube channel.
- "The ACCC has stated that Google will not be required to charge Australians for\
  \ using free services like Google Search and YouTube \u201Cunless it chooses to\
  \ do so\u201D."
- Google says that every digital service Google and Facebook provide that uses news
  content will be affected by the code.
- "Consultation on the ACCC\u2019s proposal finishes on Friday. The code is aimed\
  \ at addressing the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech\
  \ giants such as Facebook and Google, and force the platforms to pay for the value\
  \ they receive from use of Australian journalism."
- The code would also require Google and Facebook to provide media companies with
  information on changes that might affect their traffic, such as alterations to news
  rankings or the search algorithm.
- Google is not alone in lobbying on this issue. Media companies, including News Corp
  and Nine, have engaged in a major public campaign to pressure government to regulate
  the digital giants.
- "Weaknesses in Australia\u2019s lobbying transparency regimes mean the public cannot\
  \ see which companies are lobbying on which issue at any one time."
- "A Google spokesman confirmed the company was engaging constructively with the government\
  \ and \u201Cparliamentarians from all parties\u201D. He said this was to share the\
  \ company\u2019s perspective and deliver a fairer code."
- "\u201CThis code as it stands is essentially unworkable,\u201D he said. \u201COn\
  \ its current terms, it would take away the fairness, independence and objectivity\
  \ of products like Google Search and YouTube. As a result the draft code will significantly\
  \ impact the products and services used by millions of Australians and Australian\
  \ small businesses every day.\u201D"
- "He said Google was not opposed to the principle of a code, and would support one\
  \ that was \u201Cworkable and fair\u201D."
