- President Donald Trump unleashed a Category 5 tweetstorm today, tweeting and retweeting
  more than 80 messages in his regular Sunday communications.
- "The Commander-in-Tweet focused on the continuing chaos in Portland, Oregon in his\
  \ early messages, chiding that city\u2019s Mayor Ted Wheeler for refusing to allow\
  \ federal intervention to quell the disturbances. Wheeler\u2019s condo complex has\
  \ since been taken over by left-wing protesters who wish to oust him, and ongoing\
  \ street clashes resulted in the death of a man on Saturday night."
- "Trump also touted his rising poll numbers after the Republican National Convention,\
  \ and threatened Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser to clean up that city\u2019\
  s massive wave of protests or accept the National Guard to do so."
- "Related Story\t\n\n\n\t\t\t'Last Week Tonight': John Oliver Addresses RNC Lies,\
  \ The Party's \"Barely Disguised Racial Panic\" And \"Infuriating\" Events Of Kenosha"
- "We\u2019ll have more communications as they come in. The tweetstorm so far:"
- "Rushing him out of basement after seeing some very disturbing numbers. Don\u2019\
  t worry, he\u2019ll go back to basement soon! https://t.co/CEMq5xowQt"

  crime, will never be able to do it!
