- Peaceful coexistence requires a system of compromise. Targeting that system is a
  recipe for violence.
- "After a caravan of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters descended on Portland, Oregon,\
  \ this weekend, aching to grapple, he praised them as \u201Cgreat patriots.\u201D\
  \ In cheering them on, Trump is pointing them, and others like them, toward a specific\
  \ target. What he seeks to eliminate is politics itself."
- Politics is such a ubiquitous term in the English language, such a seemingly fixed
  part of American life, that its existence is assumed and its definition rarely considered.
  Our concept of politics, descended from antiquity, is that society can peaceably
  settle its differences of opinion and interests. For politics to properly play its
  becalming role, citizens must agree on rules. Discussion, persuasion, and a willingness
  to accept temporary defeat are the political means by which a society adjudicates
  its inevitable conflicts. When a society discards politics, violence assumes its
  place. This threat is already evident in the deaths of two people protesting a police
  shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and that of a member of a right-wing group in Portland.
  Another president would make a show of easing tensions, but Trump deliberately escalates
  them.

- "Since Donald Trump first announced his presidential bid in 2015, he has promised\
  \ to dispense with politics. At first, this promise seemed banal in its familiarity\u2014\
  so it initially struck many voters and journalists as more benign than it should\
  \ have. Generations of rich men running for office, after all, had promised to replace\
  \ the values of politics with the ethos of business. Besides, the art of the deal\
  \ is what every great parliamentary leader claims to practice."
- "But over the course of his presidency\u2014or perhaps from the moment he explicitly\
  \ shunned the principle of compromise and declared, \u201CI alone can fix it\u201D\
  \u2014Trump has abundantly shown that he means his anti-political rhetoric. And\
  \ as he stands for reelection, his strategy for victory amounts more and more to\
  \ the subversion of politics."
- "Although he goes through the motions of pursuing an outright victory, much of his\
  \ rhetoric is now focused on discrediting the political process itself. He disparages\
  \ the rules that govern politics and the institutions that facilitate it. He seems\
  \ to want his supporters to believe that their electoral participation will be rendered\
  \ meaningless. Trump\u2019s argument goes like this: Because their views will be\
  \ censored by Facebook and Twitter, his followers won\u2019t have access to the\
  \ most important modern forums for persuasion and mobilization. (This argument played\
  \ a starring role at the Republican convention.) On Election Day, their votes will\
  \ be negated by fraud on a massive scale, in the form of mail-in voting. Because\
  \ the probability of an unfair election is so high, the president declines to say\
  \ that he will accept the outcome of the vote."
- In the past, groups that have felt disenfranchised have turned to protest, a peaceful
  attempt to persuade well-meaning elites or beneficent institutions to expand democracy.
  But in the Trumpian worldview, those elites and institutions are conspiring against
  him. By delegitimizing the American political system, he has given his followers
  the impression that they have no choice but to assert themselves through nonpolitical
  means.
- "Daniel J. Myers: Getting \u2018tough\u2019 on protests is counterproductive"
- "Throughout his presidency, he has offered his winking approval to supporters who\
  \ have relied on menace and weaponry. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to disavow\
  \ the tiki-torch mob in Charlottesville, and he paid obeisance to the people in\
  \ camouflage who invaded the Michigan statehouse to protest stay-at-home orders.\
  \ At his recent convention, he allocated prime time to the armed couple from St.\
  \ Louis. So when he tweeted his approval of the caravan that wended its way through\
  \ Portland, armed with paintball guns and pepper spray, it was the logical culmination\
  \ of his argument\u2014and a likely prelude to the months to come."
- "Trump is hardly alone in his turn away from politics\u2014which is part of what\
  \ makes this moment so terrifyingly volatile. However marginal their numbers, anarchists\
  \ seem intent on magnifying their presence by fomenting mayhem. Among a smattering\
  \ of intellectuals on the left, looting is accepted as an appropriate form of political\
  \ speech. But Trump is heir to a more establishment strain of anti-politics. Rather\
  \ than accepting the rules of the game, his party has used parliamentary gimmickry\
  \ to achieve its most important ends. It derailed the nomination of a Supreme Court\
  \ justice in order to protect a conservative majority, and it has sought to maintain\
  \ power through gerrymandering."
- "Trump is the continuation of this tradition, even as he has pushed it forward to\
  \ a dangerous new place. During the Gingrich era, Republicans flirted with making\
  \ common cause with militias, but ultimately backed away. Today, Fox News hosts,\
  \ conservative intelligentsia, and even the president himself portray the armed\
  \ citizen as America\u2019s best hope of staving off an enemy horde."
- "In 1962, the British political theorist Bernard Crick wrote an invigorating manifesto\
  \ called In Defense of Politics. A social democrat who would later become George\
  \ Orwell\u2019s biographer, Crick waxed lyrical about the civilizing virtues of\
  \ politics, which forced humans to transcend their most destructive impulses. American\
  \ democracy is far from experiencing politics in such an ennobling form, but it\u2019\
  s very close to realizing the catastrophic consequences of its collapse. Donald\
  \ Trump may believe that his denigration of politics is his best chance at staying\
  \ in the public building whose grounds he festooned with his campaign logo during\
  \ his acceptance speech last week. But if his supporters truly come to believe that\
  \ the game is rigged, that persuasion is impossible, then his argument acquires\
  \ a dark and inevitable logic. When politics ceases to function, when the rules\
  \ governing its practice have been dismissed as a hoax, all that remains is the\
  \ barrel of the gun."
