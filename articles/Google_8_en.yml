- "Google\u2019s privacy settings don\u2019t just confuse its users \u2014 they confuse\
  \ its employees too, according to internal documents unsealed in a lawsuit over\
  \ Google\u2019s data collection."
- "\u201CThe current UI feels like it is designed to make things possible, yet difficult\
  \ enough that people won\u2019t figure it out,\u201D one Google employee said, according\
  \ to the heavily redacted documents that were newly unsealed today. The lawsuit\
  \ was originally filed by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich in May; the new\
  \ information in the unsealed documents was first reported on by The Arizona Mirror."
- "\u201CEven top-level Google employees do not understand under what conditions Google\
  \ collects location data,\u201D Brnovich and his team wrote in the complaint."
- "The Arizona investigation was kicked off by a 2018 Associated Press article showing\
  \ that Google services will store location data from your Android device or iPhone\
  \ \u2014 even if you \u201Cpause\u201D a setting called \u201CLocation History.\u201D\
  \ Even with that setting switched off, some Google apps automatically store location,\
  \ along with a timestamp, anyway."
- "\u201CI agree with the article,\u201D a Google employee wrote in the documents\
  \ released today. \u201CLocation off should mean location off; not except for this\
  \ case or that case.\u201D"
- "Google says it is cooperating with the Arizona attorney general, and has supplied\
  \ documents and answered questions raised by investigators. \u201CPrivacy controls\
  \ have long been built into our services and our teams work continuously to discuss\
  \ and improve them,\u201D says Jose Castaneda, a spokesperson for Google. \u201C\
  In the case of location information, we\u2019ve heard feedback, and have worked\
  \ hard to improve our privacy controls. In fact, even these cherry picked published\
  \ extracts state clearly that the team\u2019s goal was to \u2018Reduce confusion\
  \ around Location History Settings\u2019.\u201D"
- "The outrage over the way Google hid extra location settings in \u201CWeb and App\
  \ activity\u201D  \u2014 deep in Google account settings \u2014 did eventually lead\
  \ the company to improve how it surfaces its privacy toggles. Small changes over\
  \ the past couple of years culminated in Google\u2019s current policy, which is\
  \ auto deleting location and search history by default for new users. Current users\
  \ still need to visit their Activity Controls page to alter their settings."
- But though Google has made changes, there is still obviously much more that it could
  do. The documents from the Arizona lawsuit make plain the confusion that users experience.
- "For instance, Google serves personalized ads to its users, and part of what it\
  \ uses to personalize those ads are location data. It\u2019s possible to turn off\
  \ ad personalization by switching off a setting \u2014 but the complaint argues\
  \ that won\u2019t stop Google from serving you ads based on your location, it just\
  \ means Google will assume that you\u2019re within a general three kilometer area\
  \ instead of using your exact GPS location on a map."
- "What\u2019s more, switching off this setting apparently doesn\u2019t change things\
  \ for Google\u2019s other ad service, DoubleClick, which is used to show ads on\
  \ other websites. Removing location information from those ads requires a different\
  \ user interface, and Google will still use general location information to target\
  \ users."
- "The settings for DoubleClick have no effect on Google ad personalization, the complaint\
  \ says. \u201CThus, a user who thought she had opted out of receiving ads based\
  \ on her location is wrong on two counts: Google still serves her location-based\
  \ ads (based on her coarse location) via that same offered such a setting daily\
  \ basis,\u201D the complaint reads. \u201CAt the same time, through these deceptive\
  \ and unfair acts and practices, Google makes it impractical if not impossible for\
  \ users to meaningfully opt-out of Google\u2019s collection of location information,\
  \ should the users seek to do so.\u201D"
