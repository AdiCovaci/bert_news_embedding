- "WASHINGTON \u2014 For a man on the edge of history, President Trump sounded calm\
  \ and relaxed. If he believes that he is on the verge of losing, he betrayed no\
  \ sign of it. Instead, he trotted out one of his favorite polls, boasted about his\
  \ popularity with Republican voters and talked about his convention\u2019s television\
  \ ratings."
- "His presidency, he declared in an interview this week, has produced \u201Can incredible\
  \ result.\u201D The stock markets are \u201Cpretty amazing,\u201D the Republican\
  \ National Convention has been \u201Cvery successful,\u201D and he has \u201Cdone\
  \ a very good job\u201D of handling the coronavirus pandemic even though more than\
  \ 180,000 Americans are dead. At the same time, he said, he has endured \u201Cterrible\
  \ things\u201D by his \u201Cmaniac\u201D opponents."
- After nearly four years in office, Mr. Trump heads into the fall campaign with a
  striking blend of braggadocio and grievance, a man of extremes who claims one moment
  to have accomplished more than virtually any other president even as he complains
  moments later that he has also suffered more than any of them. He inhabits a world
  of his own making, sometimes untethered from the reality recognized by others. He
  has imposed his will on Washington and the world like no one else.
- "While previous presidents evolved in office as they learned the mechanisms of power\
  \ and adjusted their goals by the time they claimed renomination, Mr. Trump remains\
  \ the same polarizing, dominating force of nature who got up four years ago and\
  \ asserted that \u201CI alone can fix it.\u201D He has not tempered with age nor\
  \ bent to convention nor been chastened by impeachment. He says he still considers\
  \ himself \u201Can outsider\u201D even while occupying the highest office in the\
  \ land."
- "In the course of a 40-minute telephone call on Wednesday, Mr. Trump struggled to\
  \ describe how he has changed. \u201CI think I\u2019ve just become more guarded\
  \ than I was four years ago,\u201D he offered, a curious notion for the least-guarded\
  \ man to sit in the Oval Office in a lifetime. \u201CI think I really am a little\
  \ bit more circumspect.\u201D"
- "By that he seemed to mean that he had hardened after the many investigations and\
  \ political attacks that have characterized his presidency. But he is not one for\
  \ introspection. How would he be different in a second term? Really not much at\
  \ all. \u201CI think I\u2019d be similar,\u201D he said. Which is exactly what his\
  \ supporters want and his opponents fear."
- Beyond more of the same, he has strained lately to define what his second-term agenda
  would be. Asked at various points, even by friendly interviewers on Fox News, he
  has offered meandering answers. His fellow Republicans seem no more certain. They
  therefore dispensed with a party platform altogether, opting instead for a simple
  resolution of loyalty to the president.
- In the interview, Mr. Trump rattled off a list of what he has done and would continue
  to do, like increasing military spending, cutting taxes, eliminating regulations,
  reinforcing the border and appointing conservative judges.
- "\u201CBut so I think, I think it would be, I think it would be very, very, I think\
  \ we\u2019d have a very, very solid, we would continue what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019\
  d solidify what we\u2019ve done, and we have other things on our plate that we want\
  \ to get done,\u201D he said."
- "If he does win, his agenda to a significant degree may be set by external forces.\
  \ He faces three overlapping crises buffeting the United States \u2014 the pandemic\
  \ that still kills roughly 1,000 people every day, the resulting economic slowdown\
  \ that idled another one million people just last week and the unrest touched off\
  \ by a string of police shootings of Black Americans, most recently in Kenosha,\
  \ Wis."
- Mr. Trump has all but put the pandemic behind him while arguing that he is best
  suited to rebuild the economy. In responding to the debate over racial justice,
  he has characteristically sought confrontation rather than calm, disparaging the
  Black Lives Matter movement, blaming street violence on what he calls radical Democrats
  and presenting himself as a stalwart defender of the police.
- Four years after his against-the-odds victory, he has claimed the nomination as
  the undisputed master of a party whose establishment did not want him. Those who
  stood against him have since been purged or have departed or have defected to former
  Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee. It has
  given Mr. Trump a unified convention and a party remade in his image to the delight
  of supporters who see him as their champion against an entitled, politically correct
  elite.
- "\u201CHe\u2019s going to be accepting the nomination as somebody who previously\
  \ was an outsider doing a hostile takeover of the party,\u201D Jared Kushner, his\
  \ son-in-law and senior adviser, said last week in an interview. \u201CHe\u2019\
  s still an outsider, but he\u2019s built a band of outsiders with him. The hostile\
  \ takeover he started four years ago is now complete.\u201D"
- The hostile takeover may be over, but the hostility is not. Mr. Trump hardly goes
  a day without getting into a battle on Twitter or on camera with some perceived
  foe. While many see him as the instigator, he sees himself as the victim.
- "Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said he once asked Mr. Trump how\
  \ he bears the attacks and accusations. \u201C\u2018You get it every single second\
  \ of every single day,\u2019\u201D he recalled telling the president. \u201CAnd\
  \ he said, \u2018Well, Jim, what are you going to do? Are you going to quit? You\u2019\
  ve got to just keep fighting.\u2019\u201D"
- "Anyone who has watched the arc of Mr. Trump\u2019s career in business, entertainment\
  \ and politics should hardly be surprised. The thrice-married scion of a real estate\
  \ family loved nothing more than a splashy ribbon-cutting and a sizzling tabloid\
  \ item. As a reality television star, he moved beyond his bankruptcies to rebrand\
  \ himself as the emblem of success. At every stage, he courted controversy, played\
  \ on racial divisions and brushed off multiple accusations of sexual misconduct,\
  \ including even lewd descriptions of women caught on tape."
- "He arrived at the White House in January 2017 as the first president never to have\
  \ served a day in political office or the military and had little time for business\
  \ as usual \u2014 or even the traditions and laws that bind a commander in chief.\
  \ After a lifetime as a smash-mouth celebrity, he became a smash-mouth president.\
  \ At 74, he turns to the same litany of political tactics he always has, just as\
  \ he relies on the same vocabulary (\u201Ctremendous,\u201D \u201Cincredible,\u201D\
  \ \u201Cnasty,\u201D \u201Cbelieve me,\u201D \u201Cwinning,\u201D \u201Closer,\u201D\
  \ \u201Cdisgusting,\u201D \u201Cdisgrace\u201D)."
- "At his first Republican National Convention, Mr. Trump called himself \u201Cthe\
  \ law-and-order candidate,\u201D much as he did again on Thursday night. When it\
  \ looked like he would lose in 2016, he claimed the election was being \u201Crigged,\u201D\
  \ a word he recycled this year while trailing Mr. Biden in the polls. Just this\
  \ week, he challenged Mr. Biden to take a drug test, much as he demanded that his\
  \ Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, do last time."
- "Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers said his refusal to bow to the Washington establishment\
  \ distinguishes him from the rest of the political class. \u201CIf you think about\
  \ it, Washington usually absorbs people,\u201D Mr. Kushner said. \u201CThey come\
  \ to town and they go to the cocktail parties and they go to the donor circles.\
  \ Trump is one of the few people who hasn\u2019t changed.\u201D"
- "\u201CInstead of trying to change to get along with people,\u201D Mr. Kushner added,\
  \ \u201Che\u2019s doubled and tripled down on the promises that he\u2019s made,\
  \ and I think he has more conviction. There\u2019s not a single policy where you\
  \ have a question about where he stands.\u201D"
- "Mr. Trump has refused to adapt to the presidency, forcing it to adapt to him. When\
  \ he took over, he started his days in the Oval Office around 9 a.m., but then complained\
  \ to aides that he was working 12 hours a day and that \u201Cthis is way too much.\u201D\
  \ Schedulers changed the routine so that his first meeting in the Oval Office rarely\
  \ starts before 11 a.m., letting him watch television and make calls from the residence\
  \ in the morning."
- His staff grows frustrated when he sometimes does not show up until 11:30 a.m. or
  even later. But he has little respect for the schedule, turning a 15-minute meeting
  into a 45-minute session. When he has had enough, he bangs his open-palmed hands
  on his desk twice to signal that a meeting is over.
- "The president\u2019s free-form style leaves aides scrambling. While phone calls\
  \ with previous presidents were highly orchestrated affairs, Mr. Trump loves nothing\
  \ more than to spontaneously call friends, lawmakers or people he just saw on Fox\
  \ News."
- "Certain allies have instant access. When the Fox media mogul Rupert Murdoch once\
  \ called while Mr. Trump was on the phone with his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump,\
  \ his executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, asked if she should tell Mr. Murdoch\
  \ that the president would call back. Mr. Trump \u201Cerupted like Mount St. Helens,\u201D\
  \ Ms. Westerhout recalled in a new memoir. \u201CNever put Rupert Murdoch on hold!\u201D\
  \ he shouted. \u201CNever!\u201D"
- "He lashes out at whoever is on hand, even if they have nothing to do with whatever\
  \ angers him, Ms. Westerhout wrote in an otherwise admiring book in which she praises\
  \ him as a generous boss. Aides cringe when they have to deliver bad news. \u201C\
  I really don\u2019t want to go in there,\u201D she recalled Sarah Huckabee Sanders,\
  \ then the press secretary, telling her. \u201CPlease don\u2019t make me.\u201D\
  \ When the president needed bucking up, Ms. Westerhout would arrange a call with\
  \ his friend Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots who has been\
  \ charged with solicitation of prostitution."
- Mr. Trump burns through staff faster than any president has in modern times. He
  has had four chiefs of staff, four national security advisers and four press secretaries
  in less than four years. Some of his harshest critics are people who once worked
  for him and emerge with tales of an erratic, reckless president who lies profusely,
  has trouble processing information and subordinates national interest to self-interest,
  as John R. Bolton, his former national security adviser, wrote in his own book.
- "Mr. Trump casts that as a failing of his former aides, not him. In looking back\
  \ at what he would have done differently, he identified personnel. \u201CI think\
  \ it\u2019s mostly people. I wouldn\u2019t have used certain people,\u201D he said.\
  \ \u201CYou have people that sometimes you think they\u2019re going to be great\
  \ and they turn out to be terrible, and sometimes you think they\u2019re going to\
  \ be terrible and they turn out to be good.\u201D"
- "Lately, some of the harshest criticism has come from relatives. His niece Mary\
  \ L. Trump wrote a scathing book about him and produced recordings she secretly\
  \ made of the president\u2019s sister Maryanne Trump Barry calling him a man with\
  \ \u201Cno principles\u201D and denouncing his \u201Clying.\u201D"
- "In the interview this week, Mr. Trump complained that the tapes were released just\
  \ as he was presiding over a funeral for his brother, Robert S. Trump, but otherwise\
  \ did not respond to his sister\u2019s criticism. \u201CThat was a very sad \u2014\
  \ it\u2019s a sad moment,\u201D he said. \u201CHey, it is what it is.\u201D"
- "But Mr. Trump rejected the portrayal of him as a lazy, television-obsessed president.\
  \ \u201CJust the opposite,\u201D he said. \u201CI don\u2019t watch very much TV.\
  \ Nobody knows what I do.\u201D He said: \u201CI work very long hours, actually,\
  \ very long hours, probably longer than just about anybody. And I think more importantly,\
  \ I think I work effectively.\u201D"
- "His own circuitous train of thought, though, sometimes ends up taking his listeners\
  \ on unpredictable journeys. When asked at first about the aides\u2019 criticism,\
  \ he wandered into a discussion of the convention audience (\u201CI looked at the\
  \ Fox ratings\u201D) and resentment at attacks on his response to the virus (\u201C\
  we haven\u2019t been treated properly on that\u201D)."
- "He has no second thoughts about the most critical decisions of his presidency.\
  \ The pandemic was the fault of China. If he had it to do over again, he said, he\
  \ would have ensured the country had more medical gear stockpiled, but he offered\
  \ no regrets for playing down the virus and insisted that his push to reopen society\
  \ in the spring was the right one despite the cascade of death that followed. \u201C\
  I think it was a good decision because look at how our economy is going up,\u201D\
  \ Mr. Trump said."
- "He rarely connects with those who have lost loved ones in the pandemic. The morning\
  \ after his wife, Melania Trump, offered empathy at the convention, he acknowledged\
  \ that many have asked why he does not. \u201CI know, I understand that,\u201D he\
  \ said. \u201CI do read that a lot and see that a lot. But I feel tremendous sorrow\
  \ and grief for the \u2014 this should have never happened.\u201D Even as he said\
  \ he felt empathy, he could not sustain it for even a full sentence before pivoting\
  \ to whom to blame."
- "His worst moments since taking office, he said, were the day he was impeached \u2014\
  \ unfairly, in his mind \u2014 and the night that Senator John McCain, Republican\
  \ of Arizona, cast the key vote dooming a Republican effort to revoke President\
  \ Barack Obama\u2019s health care program. He acknowledged at the time that the\
  \ job was harder than he had expected."
- "Now he says it is harder because of the attacks he endures. \u201CIt\u2019s harder\
  \ because I\u2019ve had two jobs,\u201D he said \u2014 being president and \u201C\
  I have to also constantly defend myself from a group of maniacs that are totally,\
  \ that have, you know, that have gone totally off the tracks.\u201D"
- "Given that, did he ever think about not running for a second term? \u201CI never\
  \ even considered that,\u201D he said. He said he was ready for four more years:\
  \ \u201CI feel good. I think I feel better than I did four years ago.\u201D"
- The very different reactions of President Trump and Joe Biden to the killing over
  the weekend of a right-wing protester in Portland are setting the tone for the next
  phase of the campaign.
- "Will you have enough time to vote by mail in your state? Yes, but it\u2019s risky\
  \ to procrastinate. Check your state\u2019s deadline."
